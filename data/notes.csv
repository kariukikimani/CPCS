"Quadruple Aim 1:( Does the CLC improve the experience of the patient/ user?)

The KPI (Does the CLC improve the experience of the patient/ user?), is answered through proxy indicators that provide information on demand for services. The assumption is that demand and continuity of care are driven by patient/user experience. 

The following subset of KPIs that are measurable using routine data are tracked to provide information on patient experience: 

1. Number of children under the age of 1 year  immunized with DPT1 and DPT3
The indicator indirectly measures the gap between Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus (DPT) vaccines, DPT1 and DPT3, reflecting the continuity of care within the facility, including the system’s ability to capture and follow up with patients.  

2. Number of 1st and 4th ANC clients per year
Receiving antenatal care at least four times,  increases the likelihood of receiving effective maternal health interventions during antenatal visits. The indicator indirectly measures the gap between ANC1 and ANC4 that reflects continuity of care within a health system, including the system’s ability to capture and follow up with patients. 

3. Number of clients seen in general outpatient department (GOPD)
This indicator measures the demand for services and the assumption is that demand is driven in part by user experience. Other factors such as availability of services, availability of medicines and supplies and need at the population level also affect services utilization.

4. Number of clients seen in Antenatal clinic (ANC)
This indicator measures the demand for services and the assumption is that demand is driven in part by user experience. Other factors such as availability of services, availability of medicines and supplies and need at the population level also affect services utilization.

5. Number of clients seen in child welfare clinic (CWC)
This indicator measures the demand for services and the assumption is that demand is driven in part by user experience. Other factors such as availability of services, availability of medicines and supplies and need at the population level also affect services utilization.
","Quadruple Aim 1: ( Does the CLC improve the experience of the patient/ user?)
There has been remarkable improvement in the utlization of all services over the years, except for 2017 when there was a health workers' strike in Kenya. A doctors' strike started in December 2016 and ended in March 2017, while a nurses' strike started in June 2017 and ended in October 2017.

Number of children under the age of 1 year  immunized with DPT1 and DPT3
There was a 179% increase in the number of children immunized with three doses of DPT in 2019 compared to 2014, with minimal loses to follow-up between DPT 1 and DPT 3 showing that there is continuity of care at the facility. There has been a consistent increase in the utilization of immunization services since 2014 except in 2017 during the health workers' strikes.

Number of 1st and 4th ANC clients per year
The gap between the number attending ANC1 and ANC4 has remained at approximately 40% except for 2017 when the gap was about 60%. Other data from the facility indicate that women initiate antenatal care late in pregnancy, with more than 50% of women attending ANC for the first time after the 24th week of pregnancy.

Number of clients seen in general outpatient department (GOPD), CWC and ANC
There has been a remarkable growth in the number of clients seen at GOPD, CWC and ANC since the launch of the CLC. Service utlization was however affected by the health workers strike in 2017.

Utilization of GOPD services has increased over the years but there was a drop in utilization in 2016 due to unavailability of medicines and supplies in the facility and in 2017 due to the health workers strike. Variability in utilization of services at GOPD is driven largely by the availability of medicines and supplies at the facility level.

Utilization of ANC services in 2017 was affected by the health workers strike, hence the drop in the number of women utilizing the service and the number of women completing 4 ANC visits. Lack of supplies especially laboratory supplies for conducting ANC profile tests,  affects demand for services. The facility is now able to mitigate the stock-outs with NHIF (Linda mama) funds.

The immunization programme at the facility is supported through  the national  vertical immunization programme which ensures consistent supply of vaccines and related supplies to the facility. The utilization of immunization services is therefore not affected by stock-outs of drugs and supplies that are supplied through the County procurement mechanisms.","Quadruple Aim 1: ( Does the CLC improve the experience of the patient/ user?)
The Dandu CLC was launched in July 2017 during the nurses' strike in kenya. However, unlike other facilities in Kenya utilization of services in 2017 increased despite the strike.There was a reduction in the number clients utilizing services in the facility in 2019 due to various reasons including; lack of medicines and supplies from July 2019 to January 2020, migration due to drought earlier in the year,  flooding in November and December 2019 and withdrawal of a Save The Children Project that was supporting community health services in January 2019.

Number of children under the age of 1 year  immunized with DPT1 and DPT3
The number of children immunized with DPT  has increased over the years. Unlike other facilities, there was no decline in numbers in 2017 due to the health workers strike. However, the numbers declined in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the reasons stated above. The continuity of care between DPT1 and DPT3 has remained high over time.

Number of 1st and 4th ANC clients per year
There has been a remarkable increase in the number of women attending 4 ANC visits. The gap between the number attending ANC1 and ANC4 remarkably reduced from 78% in 2016 to 49% in 2019.

Number of clients seen in general outpatient department (GOPD), CWC and ANC
The utilization of GOPD, CWC and ANC services has improved since the launch of the CLC, however the utilization of services declined in 2019 except for ANC due to the reasons stated above.","Quadruple Aim 1: ( Does the CLC improve the experience of the patient/ user?)
The Makueni P4PC feasibility pilot was launched in July 2018 afterwhich the contrsuction and renovation of buildings in the facilities started. The equiping of the facilities was completed in April 2019.  Although the facilities' catchment population is approximately 20,000 people and the facilities have been operating in full  functionality for just over a year, there has been an increase in the number of people utilizing services in all the three facilities in 2019 compared to 2018.

Number of children under the age of 1 year  immunized with DPT1 and DPT3
The number of children immunized with DPT1 and DPT3 has increased compared to 2018 with a <3% gap between DPT1 and DPT3.

Number of 1st and 4th ANC clients per year
The number of women attending 1st and 4th ANC visits has increased in the three facilities, comparing 2019 to 2018. The increase in ANC1 shows increased demand for services while increases in ANC4 shows that the facility is able to ensure continuity of care for ANC services. Both demand and continuity of care are partly driven by clients' satisfaction with the services offered.

Number of clients seen in general outpatient department (GOPD), CWC, ANC and deliveries
The utilization of GOPD, CWC, ANC and maternity services has increased comparing 2018 and 2019. The increase in utilization indicates improved demand for services which is partly driven by clients' satisfaction with the services offered.","1. Addresing supply-side constraints to service utilization,  such lack of equipment, infrastructure and human resource gaps, improves utilization of services at primary health facilities. However, service utilization is affected by other health system challenges such as inefficient supply chain that delay the supply of commodities and medicines to facilities, late disbursements of funds and human resource challenges. The Makueni model that includes a shared role in facility management, has helped in improving financial flow to the facilities and addressing the human resources gaps. 
2. Although utilization for ANC has improved over the years, women still initate ANC late highlighting the need to strengthen community health services for early referrals

"Quadruple Aim 2: (Does the CLC contribute to improving patient outcomes?)

The following KPIs that can be populated using routine data available at the facility level are used to track improvements in patient outcomes as a result of the CLC:

1. Fresh still-birth rate per 1000 births
This indicator reflects the quality of intrapartum care for births at the facility. A major cause of intrapartum or early very neonatal death is asphyxia, which can result from poorly managed obstetric complications and from the absence of neonatal resuscitation. This indicator focuses on the intrapartum deaths that could be averted by the health system’s ability to provide quality obstetric care. 

2. Proportion low birth weight (LBW) infants (<2500g) out of the total live births at the facility level
Low birth weight is an important predictor of new­born survival and it contributes to neonatal mortality. It is a reflection of broader public health issues such as maternal malnutrition, ill-health and poor antenatal care.

3.Proportion of pre-term births (babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed)
Pre-term birth complications are a leading cause of death to neonates and children under the age of five years. This is a proxy indicator on neonatal mortality, morbidity and longterm adverse health consequences. 

4. Number of fully immunized children <1 years
Immunization programmes are most cost-effective way to reduce child mortality. The number of children fully immunized is a proxy measure for morbidity and mortality averted due to vaccine preventable diseases



","Quadruple Aim 2: ( Does the CLC contribute to improving patient outcomes?)
There has been an improvement in all the measured health outcomes indicators since the launch of the facility in 2014. The maternity services started in July 2014 after the launch of the facility. The number of deliveries and number of children immunized declined in 2017 due to the health workers strike in 2017.

Fresh still-birth rate per 1000 births
FSB rate/1000 births reduced from 26.5/1000 births in 2014 to 15.4/1000 in 2019, indicating improvements in intrapartum outcomes. There were no FSBs reported in 2017 which could be attributed to the low number of deliveries at the facility level due to the health workers strike. 

Proportion low birth weight (LBW) infants (less than 2500g) out of  the total live births at the facility level
There has been a steady decline in LBW births at the facility level from 7.5% in 2014 to 3.5% in 2019. Although low birth weight is a reflection of broader public health issues, it is an important predictor of newborn survival. Published literature shows that more than 80% of neonatal deaths are in low birth weight infants.

Proportion of pre-term births (babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed)
The proportion of pre-term births reduced from 3.2% in 2014 to 1.2% in 2019. Pre-term births are an important predictor of neonatal deaths especially in low resource countries which lack or have low quality essential newborn care. 

Number of fully immunized children <1 years
The number of fully immunized children under the age of one years, increased from 684 in 2013 to 1891 in 2019. The number declined in 2017 due to the health workers strike. The indicator is a proxy measure for continuity of care and morbidity and mortality averted due to vaccine preventable diseases.
","Quadruple Aim 2: ( Does the CLC contribute to improving patient outcomes?)
There has been a reduction in reported  stillbirth rate and number of children fully immunized since the launch of the Dandu CLC in 2017. However, the proportion of reported low birth weight births and pre-term births has increased. The increases could be due to improvements in reporting or due to other factors in the community such as maternal malnutrition, health and quality of ANC care. 

Fresh still-birth rate per 1000 births
FSB rate/1000 births reduced from 30.2/1000 births in 2016 to 9.8/1000 in 2019, indicating improvements in intrapartum outcomes. The reported FSBs were lowest in 2017 whic could be attributed to lower number of deliveries at the facility level due to the health workers strike or low reporting levels. 

Proportion low birth weight (LBW) infants (less than 2500g) out of  the total live births at the facility level
Reported LBW births at the facility level rose  from 0.69% in 2016 to 2.39% in 2019. Low birth weight is a reflection of broader public health issues such as maternal malnutrition than could have been caused by the extended drought in 2019. LBW is an important predictor of newborn survival, published literature shows that more than 80% of neonatal deaths are in low birth weight infants.

Proportion of pre-term births (babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed)
There were no reported pre-term births in 2016 and  the prevalence of pre-term births was 8.76% in 2019. Pre-term births are an important predictor of neonatal deaths especially in low resource countries which lack or have low quality essential newborn care. 

Number of fully immunized children <1 years
The number of fully immunized children under the age of one years, increased from 422 in 2016 to 810 in 2018 but reduced to 524 in 2019. The number declined in 2019 decreased to all the reasons mentioned above. The indicator is a proxy measure for continuity of care and morbidity and mortality averted due to vaccine preventable diseases.","Quadruple Aim 2: ( Does the CLC contribute to improving patient outcomes?)
There has been an improvement in the number of deliveries in the three facilities in Makueni and the number of reported fresh stillbirths, pre-term births and low birth weight infants has increased. The number of fully immunized children under the age of one year has increased.

Fresh still-birth rate per 1000 births
One fresh still birth was reported in Emali HC while no FSBs were reported in Matiku and Tutini. This is due to the few numbers of deliveries ensuring that labour is monitored more closely unlike in high workload facilities. 

Proportion low birth weight (LBW) infants (less than 2500g) out of  the total live births at the facility level
Proportion of births with LBW decreased in Emali and increased in Matiku and Tutini. The increases in Matiku and Tutini could be attributed to the increase in the number of births in the facilities. Although LBW is a reflection of broader public health issues, it is an important predictor of newborn survival. Published literature shows that more than 80% of neonatal deaths are in low birth weight infants.

Proportion of pre-term births (babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed)
The proportion of pre-term births decreased in Emali and increased in Matiku and Tutini. The increases in Matiku and Tutini could be attributed to the increase in the number of births in the facilities. Pre-term births are an important predictor of neonatal deaths especially in low resource countries which lack or have low quality essential newborn care. 

Number of fully immunized children <1 years
The number of fully immunized children under the age of one years increased in Emali and Matiku and slightly declined in Tutini. The indicator is a proxy measure for continuity of care and morbidity and mortality averted due to vaccine preventable diseases.","Investiments in primary health care improve health outcome indicators. However, as demand for services increases due to the improved facilities, there is need to further invest in quality of care. Measures such as improving health workforce, training, strengthening of referral systems, increasing and ensuring regular supply of medicines and commodities to match demand are needed to safeguard the gains made in improving health outcomes."
"Quadruple Aim 3: (Does the CLC help improve staff experience?) 
There are no available data routinely collected through the health information systems at the facility that can be used to measure staff satisfaction.",No data available,No data available,No data available,No data available
"Quadruple Aim 4: (Does the CLC contribute to cost reduction of (health)care?)

Healthcare cost data are not readily available in the facilities. However, our assumption and evidence from  literature is that improved demand at PHC lowers the costs of delivering care at a health system level by reducing the number of patients that by-pass lower levels and directly access care at higher levels of care. Availability of health services at PHC facilities that are located nearer the community also reduces the cost of care from the patient's perspective.

For the Makueni facilities, the indicator on the amount of money claimed from NHIF as a reimbursement for services rendered is used as a proxy for financial sustainability of the facilities. PHC facilities in Kenya receive money from the County, however, the disbursements are usually irregular and inadequate.  Although the indicator does not directly indicate lower costs of care, the facilities are able to use the money to buy medicines and supplies when there are stock-outs hence reducing out-of-pocket spending for clients.
",No data available,No data available,"Quadruple Aim 4:(Does the CLC contribute to cost reduction of (health)care?)
The indicator on total financial reimbursements from the NHIF is used as a proxy indicator for costs of health care. The assumption is that the eligible services are subsidized through refunds from the national insurer therefore reducing the costs offering care from the County and facility perspective. There was a 10 times increase in the reimbursement for Emali comparing 2018 to 2019, while Matiku and Tutini recieved reimbursements for the first time in 2019. The improved efficiency in filing NHIF claims is attributable to the availability of the  P4PC facility manager to support facility level managament.", The shared role of health facilities management in the Makueni Project improves adminstrative efficiency at the facility level.
